Bug #1:	Append vs Order

	If a json file has multiple tracks with individual note arrays,
	the current code appends them. That is, puts the next array at the back.
	Many json files contains a left and right hand section. This means
	that the right hand completes play and then the left hand begins.
	This defies what the time-played variable implies. The note array should
	be interleaved based on the time-played variable rather than appending.
