	The past months have been spent trying to create a chain from MIDI files into Tensorflow and back.
Our initial plan was to convert MIDI files to text or CSVs, but those formats lacked good parsers. The
tools we found were impossible to run with modern operating systems. As a result, we've switched tack
to convert the MIDI files into JSON files. By the next report we plan to have converted our backlog of
files into Java objects using first the converter to JSON and next the Java program provided by our
mentor, Dr. Gashler, to break JSON files into manipulable objects.

	After a failed attempt to parse the JSON files into Java objects, it was decided to use Python
and this has been finalized today. The product is complete and now work has begun on created a tensor
with all of the relevant data.
