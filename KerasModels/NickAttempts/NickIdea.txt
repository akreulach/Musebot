---- Changes ----
Task: Make some form of distinction for different song files instead of straight notes. 
	Reasoning: If we're trying to make coherent music and give it songs in different keys, the patterns will be more accurate.

	How: Load in each array of notes uniquely into the array instead of appending them. Maybe id with a #. Could make the list hold the length of the notes too.

Task: The Merge layer

Task: Compilers - We should use to get the model for training

Task: Train On Batch - Good for using lots of data 

Complete: fit_Generator - Trains the model on data generated batch by batch: efficinecy stuff

Task: predict_Generator - Tests on a generator 

Task: LSTM https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py

Complete: Way more nodes 

Task: Split up files for simplicity

Task: if this doesnt work we can cherry pick what identifiers go with which characteristic
